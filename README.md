# Cosmic-Roots
he project is currently in the active development phase. Once the AWS credits are approved, the following features will be fully testable:  3D Galaxy Visualization: Interactive family tree rendering using Three.js.  AI Reasoning: Amazon Nova integration for kinship analysis and 'Gravitational Match.'  
# 🌌 Cosmic Roots: 3D AI-Powered Genealogy

**Cosmic Roots** is an innovative platform that transforms traditional 2D family trees into an immersive 3D interstellar journey. By leveraging **Amazon Nova AI**, we preserve ancestral legacies and help the younger generation build secure, value-based connections for the future.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **3D Galaxy Visualization:** Your family tree is rendered as a navigable star system using **Three.js**.
* **Voice Heritage (Nova Sonic):** AI-powered restoration of ancestral voice recordings, allowing you to "hear" history.
* **Gravitational Match (Nova Pro):** Advanced reasoning to find compatible life partners based on family heritage, values, and genetic safety.
* **Multimodal Memories:** Integration of photos, videos, and documents into celestial nodes.
